Which network function ts responsible for managing the PDU Session In 5G?
SMF
© gNB
© AMF
© UPF
What is the function of the SMF in relation to the PDU Session?
© It encrypts user data for security
It handles the establishment, modification, and termination of PDU sessions and allocates IP addresses to UEs
© It manages handover between radio access networks
© It monitors user mobility between cells
In a 5G network, which protocol is used between the UE and UPF for data transfer during a PDU session?
© TCP
© DNS
GTP-U (GPRS Tunneling Protocol - User plane)
© HTTP
What does the term bun (Data Network Name) specify in the context of a PDU session?
© The radio access technology used
© The encryption method for user data
@} The network slice or specific data network to which the PDU session is connected
© The priority of control plane signaling
Which of the following is true regarding the Ethernet PDU Session in 5G?

It allows the UE to connect to a data network using an Ethernet interface, often for enterprise or industrial loT use cases
© It is limited to non-GBR traffic only
© It is only used for voice services
How are multiple QoS flows handled within a single PDU session?
© All QoS flows must have the same priority level
A single PDU session can carry multiple QoS flows, each identified by a unique QFI (QoS Flow Identifier)
© Only one QoS flow is allowed per PDU session
© QoS flows are handled by the AMF
What is the primary difference between Ipv4/IPv6 PDU Session and Ethernet PDU Session in 5G?
© |IPv4/IPv6 PDU session is only used for loT devices
Ethernet PDU session enables Layer 2 connectivity, whereas IPv4/IPv6 PDU session provides Layer 3 IP connectivity

Which type of QoS flow is typically used for real-time applications like video calling or online gaming?
[©] GBR
© Non-GBR
© Delay-insensitive QoS
© Reflective QoS
What is the role of Reflective QoS in 5G?
© Itis used to ensure a minimum bit rate
© It only applies to delay-sensitive traffic
© It is responsible for encryption of user data
It allows the UE to apply the QoS rules of the downlink flow to the corresponding uplink flow automatically
In 5G QoS, Delay Critical GBR flows are used for which type of traffic?
© Non-critical background traffic
@) Ultra-low latency applications, such as industrial automation
© High-bandwidth data downloads

© The minimum bit rate for each Qos flow
© The overall latency of QoS flows
The maximum bit rate allowed for all Non-GBR flows for a specific UE or session
Which QoS parameter specifies the Packet Error Rate (PER) for a QoS flow?
PER defines the maximum acceptable packet error rate for a given QoS flow
© Traffic Handling Priority (THP)
© Packet Delay Budget (PDB)
© AMBR
What does the Traffic Handling Priority (THP) parameter do?
© Defines the maximum number of packets that can be sent
© Controls the encryption level for user traffic
It determines the order in which packets are handled in case of congestion

© The maximum data rate for a QoS flow
What is the role of are (Allocation and Retention Priority) in 5G QoS?
© It manages handover procedures between cells
© It defines the maximum bit rate for GBR flows
© It specifies the data encryption level for user traffic
It determines the priority for resource allocation and retention of QoS flows during congestion
What is cbr (Guaranteed Bit Rate) in the context of 5G QoS parameters?
